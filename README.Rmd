## Predicting March Madness

Kaggle's [March Madness prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018/) is an accessible introduction to machine learning.  If you happen to like college basketball, you'll like that in this competition you can't bust your bracket, since you make a prediction for every game.  Plus this year there's a big prize pool, and luck plays a big enough role that you can be a legit contender fairly easily.

In 2016, my simple process using tidyverse functions in R placed in the top 10%.  I refined it a bit for 2017 and finished in the top 25%.

I'm sharing my code and process here for others to use as a starting point.  My approach is similar to that of the 2014 winners, Gregory Matthews and Michael Lopez.  They published [a paper about the role that luck plays in this competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0248), putting their model in perspective.  A takeaway: take  my model, tweak it a bit to generate some distance from the field, and you are competitive to win!

## What's here

In the Kaggle competition, you estimate how likely it is that Team A beats Team B, for each of the 2,278 possible matchups in the tournament.  **[My guide](march_madness_how_to.md)** documents a set of scripts for each step of:

* Deciding on possible input parameters
* Scraping the input data with the `rvest` package
* Cleaning and joining data sources to get tidy, prediction-ready data
* Training and evaluating machine learning models on the data
* Making and submitting predictions
